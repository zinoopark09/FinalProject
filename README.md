## RQLIB
### Requirements and Libraries Finder
### Final Project, 2019 FALL, CSCI E-29
#### Gabriel Guillen, Zinoo Park

Wouldn't it be nice if we had a way of knowing which requirements and libraries were installed or not installed where ?
It is every so annoying to find your app working at home only to find that it breaks down on Travis just because
a library or a module was not included in the Pipfile.

The features designed are as below:

1. Find libraries installed in MAIN & libraries installed via PIPENV

2. Find where the dependencies are installed. Pathwise.

3. Show Dependency Tree

4. Convert Pipfiles to Travis versions
